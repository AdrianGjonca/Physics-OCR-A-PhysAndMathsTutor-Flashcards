# Physics-OCR-A-PhysAndMathsTutor-Flashcards
The flash cards from the Physics and Maths tutor website, unmodified. Merely transferred into a large anki deck.

The cards have been screenshotted from the Physics And Maths tutor website, and placed (in question:answer pairs) into 'Basic'-type anki cards. The cards are organized as they are found on the website. [https://www.physicsandmathstutor.com/physics-revision/a-level-ocr-a/]

As this does not contain any modification; and I believe I have complied with the original licensing of physicsandmathstutor.com. Hence the licensing follows the same as the original [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/]. If there are any issues please contact me and we can resolve them asap.

The only condition I place is that my physics teacher Mr Millington does not use, view, download or otherwise interact with my work. This is as I have put quite the few hours of labor into compiling this and feel he should not be able to freely access my 'intellectual property', just as I cannot access his. 

These are for the A-Level OCR A Physics course.

As the file is too large to store on GitHub (>25MB) I have provided a google drive link down below:
